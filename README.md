# Unveiling Pathways: Analyzing Cyclistic's Bike Rental Data to Convert Casual Riders into AnnualÂ Member
_A Google Data Analytics Case Study_
## Introduction
Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-share company, aims to increase its number of annual memberships, which offer greater financial benefits compared to casual users who opt for single-rides or day passes.

To address this objective, the marketing team, under the guidance of the director, has taken on the task of analyzing the previous year's bicycle ride data to identify opportunities for converting casual riders into annual members.

As a member of the marketing team, my role involves conducting a thorough examination of the available bike-sharing data to uncover distinct usage patterns and behaviors among annual members and casual riders.

This case study follows a comprehensive six-stage data analysis method (__Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act__) to provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations that inform decision-making and drive the conversion of casual riders into loyal annual members.
## Phase I: Ask
### Business Task
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of Cyclistic's bike rental data in order to discern the behaviors and usage patterns of casual riders in contrast with the annual members. This analysis aims to uncover key insights need to convert casual riders to annual members.

From these insights, devise an effective marketing strategy that caters to the identified preferences of casual riders. Finally, present the results of the data analysis and the proposed marketing strategy to Cyclistic's executive team, using professional and insightful data visualizations, to secure buy-in and approval of the recommended course of action.
## Phase II: Prepare
### Data Source

## Phase III: Process
### Tools
SQL was used for comprehensive data integration, cleansing, transformation, validation, exploration, and analysis. Additionally, Looker was used for further analysis, and for the presentation of findings using interactive charts.
### Data Integration
Data Integration was done through SQL - [Data Integration](https://github.com/low-boat/cyclistic-da-case-study/blob/main/Data%20Integration.sql)
This step gave us a dataset of 5,779,444 rows and 14 columns. 
| column_name       | data_type  |
|-------------------|------------|
| ride_id           | STRING     |
| rideable_type     | STRING     |
| started_at        | TIMESTAMP  |
| ended_at          | TIMESTAMP  |
| start_station_name| STRING     |
| start_station_id  | STRING     |
| end_station_name  | STRING     |
| end_station_id    | STRING     |
| start_lat         | FLOAT64    |
| start_lng         | FLOAT64    |
| end_lat           | FLOAT64    |
| end_lng           | FLOAT64    |
| member_casual     | STRING     |
### Data Transformation
To enhance the data analysis, two additional columns were added. Here's the SQL code for this [data transformation](https://github.com/low-boat/cyclistic-da-case-study/blob/main/Data%20Transformation.sql)

`ride_length` - This column calculates for the trip duration by finding the difference between the `ended_at` and `started_at columns`.

`day_of_week` - This column extracts the day of the week from the `started_at` column to identify the specific day when each trip occurred (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).

| column_name       | data_type  |
|-------------------|------------|
| ride_length       | FLOAT64    |
| day_of_week       | STRING     |
